Using Javscript (AngularJS) for client side scripting to provide UI page after describing instances. Terribly buggy (still needs A LOT of optimizing but does the job (sometimes).

Using Python (flask) for backend processing and web server processing.

To give a try, launch a new Amazon Linux instance using "ec2-user-data". Then browse to port 5000 of that instance.

NB!! Make sure that instance has IAM permissions to make ec2 API calls. There's no error checking so it'll crash
